Assessment | CW Description
Note:

This is a take-home assessment.

Description:

Develop a personal finance management system that individuals can use to track expenses, budgets, and savings. Utilize SQLite for offline, local data storage and Oracle Database for centralized financial data management.
 
1.	Explain the dual-role approach:
•	Justify the use of SQLite 
•	Highlight the advantages 

2.	Identify and gather requirements for the system, focusing on features such as
•	Expense tracking
•	Budget creation and monitoring
•	Savings goal management
•	Synchronization between SQLite (local) and Oracle DB (central)

3.	Design the logical and physical database structures for both SQLite (local) and Oracle Database (centralized), ensuring compatibility for syncing data between the two.

4.	Implement the SQLite database to,
•	Create tables for tracking expenses, budgets, and savings.
•	Include primary key and foreign key constraints, as well as Not Null and Unique constraints.
•	Develop SQL scripts for performing CRUD operations locally.

5.	Implement the Oracle database to,
•	Aggregate and analyze data synced from SQLite.
•	Include advanced constraints like check constraints and default values.
•	Create Oracle PL/SQL procedures for managing CRUD operations centrally.

6.	Develop and demonstrate synchronization logic
•	Design mechanisms to sync local SQLite data to the Oracle database periodically.
•	Handle conflict resolution during the synchronization process.

7.	Generate five insightful financial reports from the Oracle database, including
•	Monthly expenditure analysis
•	Budget adherence tracking
•	Savings goal progress
•	Category-wise expense distribution
•	Forecasted savings trends Use PL/SQL programming techniques and SQL statements involving WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CASE, and loops.

8.	Discuss data security and privacy measures required for protecting sensitive financial information in both SQLite and Oracle DB. Provide specific examples of encryption and access control for each database.
9.	Propose a backup and recovery strategy
For SQLite: Explain how users can locally backup and restore their data files.
For Oracle Database: Provide a robust backup plan, including periodic backups and disaster recovery measures.

Deliverables:
1.	Fully implemented databases
•	SQLite: Local database for offline use.
•	Oracle Database: Centralized database for analytics and synchronization.
2.	Documentation
•	Report must include
o	TOC
o	Introduction
o	Database designs (Logical and Physical)
o	SQLite SQL scripts and Oracle PL/SQL procedures
o	Synchronization mechanisms
o	Generated reports and PL/SQL programs
o	Data security and privacy mechanisms
o	Backup and recovery plans
o	Migration plan
3.	Document formatting
