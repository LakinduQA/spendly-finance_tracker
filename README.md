## 🚀 QUICK START (For the Impatient!)

**Don't want to read? Just want to run it?**

1. **Install Python** (if you don't have it): https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - ⚠️ **CHECK "Add Python to PATH"** during installation!
2. **Download this project** (ZIP or clone)
3. **Double-click `SETUP.bat`** in the project folder
4. **Choose option 2** (Populate Sample Data)
5. **Browser opens** → Login as `john_doe` → Explore!

**That's it!** ✨

👉 **Having issues?** Read the [**Complete Setup Guide**](COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md) (for non-technical users)

---


**This is basically the first working version** - got all the core features done according to the coursework requirements (check `cw.md`), but I know it probably needs some polish and optimization. That's where you guys come in! 

Please clone this, run it on your machine, and **give me your honest feedback**. What works? What's broken? What can be improved? I'm totally open to suggestions and will refine this based on your reviews.

⚠️ **Fair warning**: I haven't done extensive testing yet, so there might be bugs I haven't caught. If something breaks, let me know!

## ✅ What I've Built So Far

Based on the coursework requirements in `cw.md`, here's what's done:

### 1. ✅ Dual Database Setup (SQLite + Oracle)
- **SQLite**: Local database for offline use
- **Oracle**: Central database for analytics
- Both databases have the same schema (9 tables each)
- Justification written in `database_designs/requirements.md`

### 2. ✅ Full Database Design
- Requirements analysis (functional + non-functional)
- ER diagrams and entity descriptions
- Physical designs for both databases
- Everything normalized to 3NF

### 3. ✅ SQLite Implementation
- 9 tables created (user, expense, income, budget, savings_goal, etc.)
- All constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- 28 indexes for performance
- 10 triggers for automation
- 5 views for reporting
- **367 sample expenses** already loaded for testing!

### 4. ✅ Oracle Implementation
- Same 9 tables with Oracle-specific features
- Sequences for auto-increment
- Advanced constraints (CHECK, DEFAULT)
- **1,400+ lines of PL/SQL CRUD package** (create, read, update, delete operations)
- **718 lines of PL/SQL Reports package** (5 financial reports)

### 5. ✅ Five Financial Reports (PL/SQL)
All using GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CASE statements, and loops:
- Monthly expenditure analysis
- Budget adherence tracking
- Savings goal progress
- Category-wise expense distribution
- Forecasted savings trends

### 6. ✅ Synchronization Module
- Python script to sync SQLite ↔ Oracle
- Handles conflict resolution
- Bidirectional sync capability
- Already tested with 390 records!

### 7. ✅ Web Application
- Flask backend (617 lines)
- Bootstrap 5 UI (clean and responsive)
- 8 pages (login, register, dashboard, expenses, income, budgets, goals, reports)
- Chart.js for visualizations
- User authentication

### 8. ✅ Security Documentation
- 32,000 characters covering:
  - Password hashing (PBKDF2)
  - Database encryption
  - SQL injection prevention
  - GDPR compliance
  - Access control

### 9. ✅ Backup & Recovery Strategy
- 40,000 characters covering:
  - SQLite backup procedures
  - Oracle RMAN backup strategy
  - Disaster recovery plan
  - Automated backup scripts

### 10. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
- 25-page final report (8,000+ words)
- 13 documentation files total
- 50,000+ words across all docs

### 🛠️ Manual Setup (If You Prefer)

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Oracle Database (optional - for Oracle features)
- DB Browser for SQLite (optional - to view database)
- SQL Developer (optional - to run Oracle reports)

**Step 1: Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LakinduQA/DM2_CW.git
cd DM2_CW
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR manually:
pip install Flask cx_Oracle
```

**Step 3: Run the Web App**

```

Then open your browser to: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

### Step 4: Login / Register
- The app has sample users already: `john_doe` and `jane_smith`
- Or just register a new account (it saves to SQLite)
- **No password required** for now (simplified for testing)

### Step 5: Explore the App

## 🧪 Testing Status

**Honestly, I haven't done thorough testing yet.** Here's what I know works and what needs checking:

### ✅ Tested & Working:
- SQLite database creation
- Sample data population (367 expenses loaded)
- Flask app starts and runs
- All web pages load
- User registration/login
- Dashboard displays data
- Charts render correctly
- Oracle connection works
- Synchronization script runs (390 records synced!)
- PL/SQL packages compile (both VALID status)

### ⚠️ Needs Testing:
- Edge cases in forms (what happens with invalid input?)
- Deleting records
- Updating budgets
- Adding goal contributions
- Error handling
- Mobile responsiveness
- Different browsers
- Performance with lots of data

### 🐛 Known Issues:
- No password encryption yet (storing plain text)
- No input validation on some forms
- Reports might be slow with large datasets
- No pagination on expense list
- Some UI polish needed

**Please test everything and report bugs!**
